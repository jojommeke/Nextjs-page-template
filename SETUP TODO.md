# todo on how to setup this template:

1. change favicon.ico and metadata in layout.js to your own preference.
2. change line 3 in next.config.js to your repo name after the slash (see comments in file)
3. add your jsx to page.js
4. run `npm run dev` to start local development server (to view your page go to http://localhost:3000/[insert repo name you set in step 2 here])
5. to build/deploy your site to github pages do `npm run build` and commit and sync changes with git, wait a bit till github processes the website (you can look for the progress in the "actions" tab on your repo)
6. That's it!
